# GIKIEats

## Introduction

GIKIEATS is a multi-platform flutter-based application to provide online food ordering facilities to its customer within GIK. This app maintains records of all Restaurants of GIK and their food items. In this app, Restaurants can add their food items and their details on the menu with ease. Customers can view the information menu provided by the restaurant. 
This is an Android/IOS application that allows you to access all the whole information about all Restaurants of GIK. Within Institute it is difficult to keep track of food items in different restaurants. This app allows you access to all the information about food items in a single place.
